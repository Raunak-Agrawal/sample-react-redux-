## Sample React Redux Project

### This project is developed using react and redux as a state management tool for building user interfaces. The data is fetched from an API with the help of actions and it gets passed down to reducer which returns the state and we can get back the state in the component using props.

### The project uses three components- A Navbar, Event Listing and a Event Detail component. The store is used to initialize the state and define the combined reducer.
